# Data Structures Algorithms Part 1
Data Structures & Algorithms - Assignment 1
This repository contains the implementation for the first assignment in my Data Structures and Algorithms course. The assignment is divided into three main components:
Components
1. Core Data Structures
Implementation of fundamental data structures including:

Linked List
Stack
Queue

2. Pseudo-Snake Game
A simplified version of the classic Snake game demonstrating practical application of data structures and algorithms.
3. Multithreading Implementation
Exploration of concurrent programming concepts and thread management techniques.
